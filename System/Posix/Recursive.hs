 Module      : System.Posix.Recursive-- Copyright   : (c) Marek Fajkus
 License     : BSD3

 Maintainer  : marek.faj@gmail.com

 All modules profided by @unix-recursive@ expose similar API.
 Make sure you're using the module wich best fits your needs based on:

 * Working  with 'RawFilePath' (faster and more packed) or 'FilePath' (slower but easier to work with safely)
 * Exception free (Default) or @Unsafe@ variants of functions

 = Usage

 This module is designed to be imported as @qualified@:

 > import qualified System.Posix.Recursive as PosixRecursive

 __Results__

 All functions return will return root path (the one they accept in argument) as a first item in the list:

 > head <$> PosixRecursive.list "System"
 > >>> "System"

 Other than that, this library __provides no guarantees about the order in which files appear in the resulting list__
 to make it possible to change the underlaying strategy in future versions.

 __Laziness__

 All IO operations are __guaranteed to be lazy and have constanct space characteristic__.
 Only the IO required by lazy computation will be performed so for instance running code like:

 > take 20 <$> PosixRecursive.listDirectories "/"

 Will perform only minimal ammount of IO needed to collect 20 directories on a root partition

{- $basic_listing
 Functions for listing contents of directory recursively.
 These functions list all the content they encounter while traversing
 the file system tree including directories, files, symlinks, broken symlinks.

  __Directories (and files) which process can't open due to permissions are listed but not recursed into.__

 Functions from this section is gurantee to always return the root path as a first element even
 if this path does not exist.

 > PosixRecursive.list "i-dont-exist"
 > >>> ["i-dont-exist"]

 In these cases the root path is considered the same way as symlink
 to non existing location.

{- $custom
 All /File Type Based Listing/ functions are based on top of this interface.
 This part of API exposes exposes access for writing custom filtering functions.

 All paths are tested for filter functions so unreadble files won't appear in the result list:

 > PosixRecursive.listCustom PosixRecursive.defConf "i-dont-exist"
 > >>> []

 It's not possible to turn of this behaviour because this functions must get the 'FileStatus'
 type which requires reading each entry.

 Functions for listing specific file type. Reading the file type requires
 ability to read the file.

 Include test is applied even for the root entry (path past in as an argument).
 This means that non existing paths are filtered.
